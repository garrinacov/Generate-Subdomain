# Generate-Subdomain
A simple and efficient Bash script for subdomain enumeration. This tool takes a list of subdomains and a main domain, combines them to generate a list of potential subdomains, and uses massdns to resolve and filter valid subdomains. It supports the use of custom DNS resolvers for large-scale subdomain scanning.
